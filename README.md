Mahor Experiment :
    - Data Analysis : analyze the extracted data to compare with Lior's Formula
    - Mahor Data Extraction : Extract the data
    - Mahor Simulation : Simulate Mahor's experiment (Growing population from one cell, then dilluting and make them grow independantly another time) and compare with Lior Formula

Moran processes : simulations with constant population
    - Epigenetic Cell : Evolutions are not stable and may disappear, then the cell comes back to its previous phenotype
    - Evolutive Cell : EVolutions are stable and rarely change, but not phenotypes. 

Unlimited Population growth : simulation where population can evolve
    - Evolution as a range of adaptation : Cells are adapted to a certain range of conditions. Outside this area, the fitness decreases fastly
    - Gillespie continuous population : The fitness is a function of the distance between a cell's best condition and actual condition
    - Simple Growing population Multiple Population : Running multiple simulation in order to track the mean evolution of each value
